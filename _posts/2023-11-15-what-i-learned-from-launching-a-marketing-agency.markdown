# What I Learned from Launching an Agency

An autopsy report on my first side-hustle: [The ABA Project](https://www.theabaproject.com/)

About a year and some change ago, I realized that my day job wasn’t hitting the marks on what I needed from a career. I wanted to make more money and I wanted to engage in work that was stimulating. So, like many young wantrepreneurs with limited technical abilities, I decided to start a marketing agency!

Now if you’ve never heard of an agency before, then I applaud you for not having your YouTube algorithm poisoned with glib, hustle-bro content. A marketing agency essentially acts as a third-party consulting firm companies can solicit for… you guessed it, marketing solutions. 

I am taking the piss out of them for how trendy the idea of starting one has become, but at their core, agency’s can serve as very mutually beneficial business partnerships. 

A successful marketing agency should provide the businesses they are serving with measurable improvements in the given domain. My wheelhouse happened to be applied behavior analysis (ABA) companies so success here could be defined as increasing patient enrollments over a given period of time or driving up the number of leads my client received. 

For marketing agencies, there are a couple of tools at your disposal to go about achieving these metrics. The traditional routes an agency may take are paid advertising, search engine optimization, social media advertising.

My value prop was to offer the above services (in addition to website development) for small-medium sized ABA companies.

## What I got right?

### Skyscraper Content

Coined by the founder of Backlinko, Brian Dean, skyscraper content is a piece of content that goes well above and beyond the industry standard. It's not just another run-of-the-mill listicle with salient but trite advice; it demands producing material that's either unique or the best in its field

In a niche market, these types of articles can be what drives the growth through the organic search traffic that it brings. They are not easy pieces of content to write but they can pay dividends to your business in the long-run. And because they are not difficult to produce, they can act as a clear demarcation line to separate you from lazy competition.

Here is a snapshot of the last three articles that I added to the site. Can you guess which one was the skyscraper content?

Not only did producing this allow me to demonstrate upfront my decent knowledge base in the space, but it also had the pleasant byproduct of actually educating me more on the mechanics of the field. In producing the “Ultimate Guide to Starting an ABA Clinic”, I developed a much better understanding for how these companies operated.

### Discovery Call

> “Failure to prepare is preparing to fail.”

This turned out to be one of the more interesting skills that I uncovered. Candidly, I’ve always been the type to get major butterflies before presentations. There were countless school presentations where it felt like I was going to explode in my seat from the nerves. So it truly came as a delightful surprise when I succeeded in my first discovery call (aka sales pitch). 

Now I certainly am no Jordan Belfort, but I learned that I can dance when the lights get turned on. And the key to it turned out to be preparation. In the one discovery call that I conducted, I did my due diligence in conducting extensive research on the client before. I looked at:

* Size of client company
* How long they had been operating
* Competition in the area
* SEO metrics for ABA therapy in the region

Having this information in my back pocket along with my presentation allowed me to breeze through the 45-minute call we had set-up. 

Internally, I was still a nervous wreck but my research and relative articulateness helped me project some degree of authority and knowledge in the space. 

### Niche Selection

Through a mix of serendipity and not half-bad intuition, I landed on a niche that was a solid option. The ABA space is a high-growth field that still happens to be relatively untapped. 

Even now if you were to look up some marketing metrics on cutting through the industry, you’d see a field with relatively few moats to hurdle.

Here is a snapshot from Semrush for the keyword “how to start an aba clinic.” Admittedly the search volume is relatively low, but the keyword difficulty of an important concept in the industry indicates a niche that is ripe for the taking. 

The other upside of this choice was that it allowed me to play to my strengths. In theory, I wielded a competitive advantage as I already knew a decent amount about the inside baseball of the ABA industry from my work experience.

This proved to be extremely helpful as I dived into the requisite research needed for this endeavor. Starting from a knowledge base of basically 0 with digital marketing was already an uphill battle. Having a foundational understanding of what people in the field wanted allowed me to dive directly into the meat of my industry research, rather than starting from scratch.

## What Went Wrong?

### Consistency:

This is a painful one to admit as it seems like the de facto litmus test that separates those bound to a painful life of wantrepreneurship and actual entrepreneurs. Those who have the chutzpah to swallow their pride and sanity through the toughest times are the ones that are able to collect on the dividends wrought by grit and perseverance. 

I can admit that my efforts with this project were very inconsistent. There were times where I would feel hyper-motivated and crunch through boatloads of work and other times where I’d work on it for maybe ~10hrs per week, if that. Like any other facet of life, forming a successful business takes consistent, earnest effort over long periods of time — not bursts of manic passion.

### Obsession over output rather input:

This is a tricky one, and frankly, one that I grapple with in many other aspects of my life. When setting targets and goals, I would always focus on the end results. “I want to have X amount of discovery calls by the end of this month”, “I want to achieve $Y in monthly recurring revenue by June”, etc.

At the end of the day, the only things I truly have ownership over are the actions I can control. I remember setting a goal for myself to have one successful cold call convert to a discovery call. About 20 uninterested cold calls later, I ended the week feeling deflated and incompetent.

Had I set the goal of hitting 40 cold calls by the end of the month, I could have taken solace in the fact that I put a tremendous amount of effort into my input-based goal instead of wallowing in the defeats.

This may sound trivial but it does make a world of difference when going through the process. When the focus is set on outcome, it makes each unsuccessful attempt feel that much worse. With an input goal, the next call just feels like I am getting closer to my success marker. And with that consistency, the desired output is typically not too far away.

Some might say that the folly in these goals was in the loftiness of them rather than where the focus lied. Perhaps there is some truth in that as well though I’d argue that the largeness of a goal is what gives me energy. Regardless, I can say with certainty that not hitting on the goal outputs certainly damaged my confidence in my abilities. 

## Niche Selection:

Yep, the thing I believed I got right also played a key role in my downfall. As good as the earlier advice of “play to your strengths” is, the advice that ultimately takes precedent stands to be “don’t shit where you eat.”

While the ABA space was a sound selection, it being my target market created a web of problems once my employer was made aware of its existence. A part of me knew that choosing to plant my flag in the space could cause things to go sideways but I figured all would be copacetic as long as I chose to work in another vertical than the one of my day job (marketing vs. finance).

This was not at all the case. After a series of HR-disputes the ultimatum was given to me: stop working on TAP or stop working for us. And so marked the end of my first foray into the world of entrepreneurship. 

## And that’s a wrap

I’ve wanted to write something like this for quite some time. After ending the project rather unceremoniously, it feels like I never gave myself the space to soberly reflect on what I tried to do. Even though I didn’t come close to the heights that I sought after, I still feel a great deal of nostalgia for the work. 

In the immediate aftermath of taking down the site, I couldn’t help but feel a profound sense of failure for not having accomplished what I wanted. Call it maturity or call it having moved on, but in writing this I do feel a sense of pride in TAP. It did not work out, but I took a fucking bite out of the apple.

I put more into the project than what I would have ever expected when I got the half-baked idea of creating a marketing agency. And now as I look towards diving into the world of tech, I feel a lot of those same feelings of wanting to achieve and build something lasting that I had when starting TAP.

Looking back, TAP was more than just a project; it was a peek at what’s possible for me to achieve if I truly commit myself to a goal.

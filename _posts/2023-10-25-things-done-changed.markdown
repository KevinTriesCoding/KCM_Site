# Things Done Changed

This website is brought to you by generative AI

I’m not going to win any groundbreaking awards with this statement, but I think it has to be reiterated for those in the back: generative AI is a game changer. 

I’ve often wondered what it must have been like to be around during the early days of the internet. Not during the ancient days of it being a government project, but when the commercial guardrails were taken off from it in the mid ‘90s. 

I've always thought that being an early-adopter during the dawn of the internet must've been a pretty wild ride. To be among the few who understood the downstream effects of this 'connecting-the-world-together' thing must have been both exhilerating and somewhat isolating. You could see in the horizon that tsunami of change coming, but to most you’d just be a Chicken Little worrying about nothing. 

AI is this generation’s version. Call me an optimist, but I believe that the effect size of AI will as grand as that of the internet. And those who are early to the gold rush stand to profit immensely. 

I am by no means early to the AI hype-train but I do believe I am in the subset of people that are leveraging more than the masses. 

## A few use-cases

I would not consider myself a luddite, but I would also hesitate to say that I am particularly tech-savvy. Despite this lack of technical acumen, I was able to produce this (if I do say so myself) well-designed website in the span of a few days. I have spent a few months learning Python for back-end development and took a computer science eons ago when I was in high school. Outside of that, I have no programming experience whatsoever.

With just a few days of assistance from ChatGPT I was able to:

- Learn what a static website is and decide that Jekyll would suite my purposes
- Quickly map out and install all the necessary packages I needed
- Implement a Jekyll theme into my site repo
- Learn all about the magic of version control
    - Go through a debugging process w/ a test branch
    - Create somewhat coherent documentation during this
- Uploaded site to Netlify for hosting

Now, for a tech veteran, I might as well have written that I learned how to wipe my ass. However, for someone like myself that is still a relative new-comer to the tech arena, this feels yuuuge! 

A project like this in a time before LLMs would have taken me weeks to set-up. And if I am being totally honest, a project like this likely would have never been completed. During set-up, I initially tried hosting through GitHub Pages and encountered an issue where despite being identical, the local host loaded correctly but GH Pages site appeared as a blank screen. An issue like this would’ve caused a schizo break as I desperately tried to find niche reddit posts with this same problem before ultimately canning the endeavor.

Instead of going down that loopy rabbit hole, I was able to communicate this problem with Chat. After attempting some debugging solutions, we finally landed on the situation to try a different hosting platform. And voila, my love of Netlify and it’s very user-friendly hosting experience was born.

(Yes, most of my dialogues with GPT are as cringe as this)

Here is just a quick snapshot of my thread for building this site. There is not another resource available that would be able to explain these concepts with this level of fidelity, dynamism, and specificity —- and chat doesn’t even think to cringe at me for unironically saying “how do I take this thing supersonic.” What a mensch!

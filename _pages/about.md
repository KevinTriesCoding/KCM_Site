Hi, my name is Kevin Moye. I enjoy writing about tech, philosophy, my latest projects, half-baked ideas, and everything in-between.

Just a twenty-something that needed a place to put all my thoughts into one place. Here's a bit about me.

I graduated from NC State University in 2021 and moved out to Austin, TX shortly after.

In my free time I enjoy writing, training muay thai, weightlifting, watching sports, and learning about the latest breakthroughs in the emerging AI space. 

I plan on sharing my writings here and more-focused writings about tech on my Substack (TBA). This site will mostly have more my more personal writings (read: ramblings) and ideas. If you like the unhinged writings, then please stick around! I promise there will be no shortage of them to go around.
